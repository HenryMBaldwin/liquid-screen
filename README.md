# Liquid Screener

A basic tool to view realtime graphed liquidity data for token pairs on dexscreener.com using the [dexscreener API](https://docs.dexscreener.com/api/reference).

Created because I couldn't figure out how to see liquidity over time on dexscreener even though the data seems to exist.

Maybe its possible and I am just an idiot.
