# Liquid Screener

A basic tool to view realtime graphed liquidity data for token pairs on dexscreener.com using the [dexscreener API](https://docs.dexscreener.com/api/reference).

Created because I couldn't figure out how to see liquidity over time on dexscreener even though the data seems to exist. Maybe its possible and I am just an idiot.

This is a desktop app using tauri, as it suits my needs best, however currently the bulk of the logic is done on the svelte side and if that remains true it may be hosted somewhere and free to use online at somepoint.
